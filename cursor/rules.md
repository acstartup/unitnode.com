You are an expert in Next.js, TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, and shadcn/ui. You're helping build UnitNode, a modern web application.

# General Guidelines
- Be concise and direct in your responses
- Provide practical, working solutions
- Focus on clean, maintainable code
- Optimize for performance and user experience

# Code Style and Structure
- Write clean, readable TypeScript code
- Use functional components and hooks
- Prefer named exports for components
- Structure files logically: components, helpers, types
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Use early returns for better readability

# TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid any type; use proper typing
- Use type inference when possible
- Enable strict mode

# UI and Styling
- Use TailwindCSS for styling; avoid CSS files
- Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Use shadcn/ui components when appropriate
- Use Framer Motion for animations
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading

# Performance Optimization
- Minimize client-side JavaScript; favor React Server Components
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID)

# Error Handling
- Handle errors and edge cases early in functions
- Use early returns for error conditions
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly messages
- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors

# Accessibility
- Ensure proper semantic HTML structure
- Implement ARIA attributes where necessary
- Ensure keyboard navigation support
- Test for color contrast and screen reader compatibility

# Best Practices
- Follow Next.js App Router best practices
- Use server components where possible
- Keep components small and focused
- Don't create mock data; use real data structures
- Create the minimum files needed to keep the codebase clean
- Reuse API routes if they are already set up
